                    <p>I have always been a tinkerer. I have a fascination for trying, testing, tweaking, and re-evaluating creative ideas. From when I was a child playing with LEGOs, until more recently as I continue learning how to produce music, build websites, and design products: this vivid curiosity and passion for learning has allowed me to flourish wholeheartedly.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my time at University, I have had the chance to perform countless interviews and usability studies, designed numerous wireframes and mockups, created proposals, and designed many prototypes of various levels of fidelity and functionality â€“ some of which you can find below.</p>
